# Let's assign variables to represent a book you enjoy.

# Step 2 - Strings
# Let's start with Python strings. Replace the "None" with the name of a book, and below the name of the author of your book.

book_name = 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'
author = 'JK Rowling'



# Step 3 - Concatenation and f-strings
# Use concatenation and f-strings to make a sentence about your author and book name.

sentence1 = book_name + "is written by" + author + "."

sentence2 = author + "wrote the book"



# Step 4 - Integers
# Now let's practice Integers. Replace the "None" below with the publication date of your book.
publication_year = 2002



# Step 5 - Floats
# Now estimate what the retail value of your book would be at a store and replace the "None" below with a float value of the price. (Doesn't have to be accurate.)
book_price = 20.99



# Step 6 - Booleans
# Now we will practice with booleans. Replace the "is_awesome" variable with a boolean. True if your book is awesome, False if your book is not awesome.
is_awesome = True



# Step 7 - print and type functions
# Follow the instructions, and below this line, code all of the suggested print statements and the type statements.
# Code below

print(author)
type(author)
print(book_name)
type(book_name)
print(book_price)
type(book_price)
print(sentence1)
type(sentence1)
print(sentence2)
type(sentence2)
print(publication_year)
type(publication_year)
print(is_awesome)
type(is_awesome)
